The following project shows different Item-based similarity algorithms on the movie lens data set.
To run the project you need an IntelJ environment where you just upload the project and run it
or using a terminal you can do the following:

Go to DatabasesProject\ItemRecommendationSystem\out\artifacts\DatabasesProject_jar
and use the following command : java -jar DatabaseProject.jar
The algorithm runs all the experimental results so you should wait around 5-10 minutes.
The first result will show the Ajdusted cosine graph then after a while it will show the cosine one
and finally the correlation. 
After that it will show a bar graph of the MAE.
